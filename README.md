This is the submission of Project2 of CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript-Design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist" using Django.

I had initially added the auction and commerce and manage.py piles inside the folder commerce. But submission got rejected so added it again on the main page but the original commerce folder still remains. Therefore,Please run the commerce folder along with python manage.py runserver.
